          <h2>About FluffyPaws</h2>

          Over here, we have beautiful and healthy puppies at reasonable prices.
          All puppies will go through proper veterinarian health checks,
          microchips and 2 vaccinations before going home. Puppies will be
          dewormed to ensure optimal nutrition absorption and growth. Getting a
          puppy is a lifetime of joy and love, not a spur of the moment. Our
          company will continue to be in touch with all owners in order to
          educate and advise them in times of need and queries.

        <h2>Why FluffyPaws?</h2>
        All our puppies are from AVS approved sources. We work closely with AVS
        Licenced Breeders to ensure that our puppies are from cruelty-free
        environments. We do not work with illegitimate sources or backyard
        breeders.Due to the new AVSâ€™ involvement and regulations, all parental
        records must be submitted to the AVS once puppy is microchipped and
        licensed. Puppyâ€™s parents with less than desirable medical records must
        be neutered or sterilized.

          <h3>Mary Lee</h3>

          After our 13 year old mini schnauzer passed on, our family decided to
          get a new puppy of the same breed as we are familiar on its
          personality and caring. Finding the right pet shop is a crucial
          criteria. One that is trustworthy, reliable, easy to communicate,
          accommodating, knowledgeable about the different breeds of dogs.
          Fluffypaws. You wonâ€™t go wrong. We appreciate the after sale check,
          ensuring the pups well-being. We are very happy with our Liâ€™l Nyx. She
          brings back joy after losing our beloved boy. Thanks to the FluffyPaws
          team!!

          Bought my beagle from fluffypaws. The team is patient and explained
          the care and management clearly. They were not pushy and also checked
          with me regarding my interest. When I decided to purchase my puppy,
          they also accommodated my pick up timings. And shared the after care
          matters. Thanks for the assistance. I am thankful and hope my puppy
          will thrive well:)

          My experience with fluffypaws purchasing my Shiba Inu was an
          outstanding one. They were very meticulous with every step of the
          puppy purchase process. On their wall is their credentials and
          certifications, I was widely impressed when a vet tech went through a
          checklist with me and I was even made aware when my puppy has a
          vaccine bump and nasal moist level. Small details like these brings
          enormous confidence to first time owners like myself. Thank you fluffypaws.

          Got our little Atom from them, very accomodating and helpful,, let our
          kids play with the puppy a few days before we can take him home. A vet
          clinic nearby is a big plus for immediate checkup. Thanks a lot ðŸ™‚

          Very clean environment, impressed with their medical knowledge in
          canine and customer treatment was impressive. Price is higher than
          other pet shops but deliever quality. Disappointed I missed the chance
          to get a furkid as the puppy I want was sold. But will come back
          again.
