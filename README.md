My website is a website that sells dogs. </br>
For the navigation bar we have the company name and logo, the homepage which is index.html, the available dogs page which is availabledogs.html, the contact us page which is contactus.html and the about us page which is aboutus.html. </br>
For my home page, I have a video at the top which shows many different dogs. I also have the description of why people should choose either small/medium breeds or the larger breeds of dogs. </br>
For the available dogs page, I have a slideshow of 3 different types of dogs that are available which the user can click to view the rest of the photos. Below the slideshow are the different dogs available. There are 9 different dogs there. I put the overlay of the text so that when you hover over the image, you can see the different dog breeds and whether its a larger or smaller/medium dog breed. It also tells you the number of puppies and adult dogs available, the genders available and how old the puppies and adult dogs are. </br>
For the contact us page, there is a map of where the store is located and users can click the map or the directions word to get the directions on how to go to the place through google maps and if they do not wish to use google maps there is also the address there and directions if they are taking public transport. There is also a form section for the users to fill in their name, email and contact number so that the company can get back to them regarding any enquires they have. </br>
The last page is the about us page which shows the user information about our company, the reason why they should choose to buy dogs from our company and the past reviews we've had from our customers. </br>
